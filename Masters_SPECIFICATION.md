## 1. GAME OVERVIEW

**Name:** 2026 Masters Fantasy Pool

**Concept:** Players select 10 golfers across 6 tiers (based on consensus betting odds) to build their fantasy lineup. Scoring uses actual tournament strokes relative to par — lowest total wins, just like real golf. Finish bonuses reward top performances; tier-scaled missed cut penalties create risk/reward dynamics across tiers.

**Target Audience:** 20–30 players via shared link

**Entry Fee:** Free (bragging rights)

Any newly qualified player will be added to the appropriate tier based on available odds data. The administrator will communicate all changes before the pick deadline.

## 4. SCORING SYSTEM

### Core Concept
Each golfer in your lineup contributes their **actual finish score relative to par** from the tournament. Your lineup's total score is the **sum** of all 10 golfers' scores. **Lowest total wins** — just like real golf.

### Finish Bonuses
Bonuses are **subtracted** from a golfer's score (improving it). Bonuses are **exclusive** — only the best applicable bonus is applied.

| Finish | Bonus |
|--------|-------|
| **Win** (1st place) | −5 strokes |
| **Top 5** (2nd–5th) | −3 strokes |
| **Top 10** (6th–10th) | −2 strokes |
| **Top 20** (11th–20th) | −1 stroke |

### Missed Cut Penalty
If a golfer misses the cut, their actual score is **discarded** and **replaced** with a fixed penalty based on their tier:

| Tier | Missed Cut Penalty |
|------|-------------------|
| 1 — Elite | **+10** |
| 2 — Strong | **+9** |
| 3 — Competitive | **+8** |
| 4 — Longshots | **+7** |
| 5 — Deep Cuts | **+6** |
| 6 — Wildcards | **+5** |

### Scoring Rules
- Scores are based on the **official Masters Tournament leaderboard** (total strokes relative to par after 4 rounds)
- A golfer's score to par is their 72-hole total minus 288 (par 72 × 4 rounds)
- Playoffs: If a golfer enters a playoff, their score is their **regulation 72-hole score** (playoff strokes do not count)
- Finish position is determined by the **official final standings** (including playoff results for position purposes)
- Ties in tournament position: all tied golfers receive the same bonus (e.g., three golfers tied for 4th all receive the Top 5 bonus of −3)
- No retroactive adjustments for disqualifications after the tournament concludes

### Scoring Examples

**Example 1:** Scottie Scheffler (Tier 1) wins the Masters at −12.
- Fantasy score = −12 − 5 (win bonus) = **−17**

**Example 2:** Shane Lowry (Tier 2) finishes T8 at −4.
- Fantasy score = −4 − 2 (top 10 bonus) = **−6**

**Example 3:** Cameron Smith (Tier 3) finishes T25 at +1.
- Fantasy score = +1 (no bonus) = **+1**

**Example 4:** Scottie Scheffler (Tier 1) misses the cut.
- Fantasy score = **+10** (Tier 1 MC penalty, replaces actual score)

**Example 5:** Bubba Watson (Tier 6) misses the cut.
- Fantasy score = **+5** (Tier 6 MC penalty, replaces actual score)

**Example 6:** Full lineup calculation.
| Pick | Golfer | Tier | Result | Score |
|------|--------|------|--------|-------|
| T1-A | Scheffler | 1 | Wins at −12 | −17 |
| T1-B | Åberg | 1 | T15 at −3 | −4 |
| T2-A | Morikawa | 2 | T3 at −8 | −11 |
| T2-B | Spieth | 2 | Missed cut | +9 |
| T3-A | Cantlay | 3 | T22 at E | 0 |
| T3-B | Burns | 3 | T10 at −2 | −4 |
| T4-A | Fowler | 4 | Missed cut | +7 |
| T4-B | Theegala | 4 | T18 at −1 | −2 |
| T5 | Tiger Woods | 5 | Missed cut | +6 |
| T6 | Bubba Watson | 6 | T30 at +3 | +3 |
| | | | **TOTAL** | **−13** |

- ✅ 38% of pools finish within 5 strokes — exciting, competitive
- ✅ Scheffler holders win 40% of pools (vs. 29% baseline) — favored but not dominant
- ✅ Avg winner has 2.3 missed cuts out of 10 — variance keeps it interesting
- ✅ 72+ billion unique lineups — no duplicate lineups possible
