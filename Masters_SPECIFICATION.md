## Final Specification Document

**Status:** 🔒 LOCKED  
**Version:** 2.0  
**Locked:** February 25, 2026

## 1. GAME OVERVIEW

**Name:** 2026 Masters Fantasy Pool

**Concept:** Players select 10 golfers across 6 tiers (based on consensus betting odds) to build their fantasy lineup. Scoring uses actual tournament strokes relative to par — lowest total wins, just like real golf. Finish bonuses reward top performances; tier-scaled missed cut penalties create risk/reward dynamics across tiers.

**Target Audience:** 20–30 players via shared link

**Entry Fee:** Free (bragging rights)

**Administrator:** Brad Hagstrom. The administrator's scoring and rules decisions are final. Any disputes are resolved at the administrator's sole discretion.

### Field Reconciliation
Tier assignments are based on consensus odds from 10 bookmakers as of February 24, 2026. The final Masters field will not be confirmed until closer to tournament week. Expected removals: ~25–28 players from the current 115 will not make the final field (~87–90 players).

- Any player who withdraws or is not in the final field will be removed from their tier before the pick deadline.
- Any newly qualified player will be added to the appropriate tier based on available odds data.
- Any player qualifying after the pick deadline is not available for selection and is excluded from the pool.
- The administrator will communicate all changes before the pick deadline.

## 4. SCORING SYSTEM

### Core Concept
Each golfer in your lineup contributes their **actual finish score relative to par** from the tournament. Your lineup's total score is the **sum** of all 10 golfers' scores. **Lowest total wins** — just like real golf.

### Finish Bonuses
Bonuses are **subtracted** from a golfer's score (improving it). Bonuses are **exclusive** — only the best applicable bonus is applied.

| Finish | Bonus |
|--------|-------|
| **Win** (1st place) | −5 strokes |
| **Top 5** (2nd–5th) | −3 strokes |
| **Top 10** (6th–10th) | −2 strokes |
| **Top 20** (11th–20th) | −1 stroke |

### Missed Cut Penalty
If a golfer misses the cut, their actual score is **discarded** and **replaced** with a fixed penalty based on their tier:

| Tier | Missed Cut Penalty |
|------|-------------------|
| 1 — Elite | **+10** |
| 2 — Strong | **+9** |
| 3 — Competitive | **+8** |
| 4 — Longshots | **+7** |
| 5 — Deep Cuts | **+6** |
| 6 — Wildcards | **+5** |

### Scoring Rules
- Scores are based on the **official Masters Tournament leaderboard** (total strokes relative to par after 4 rounds)
- A golfer's score to par is their 72-hole total minus 288 (par 72 × 4 rounds)
- **Playoffs:** A golfer's score is their **regulation 72-hole score to par** — playoff strokes do not count. The playoff result determines finish position for bonus purposes.
- **Tied finish positions:** All tied golfers receive the same bonus (e.g., three golfers tied for 4th all receive the Top 5 bonus of −3)
- **Withdrawals and disqualifications:** See Edge Cases (Section 8)
- No retroactive adjustments for disqualifications after the tournament concludes

### Scoring Formula
```
If golfer makes the cut:
  Fantasy Score = (72-hole score to par) + (best applicable bonus)
  
  Where bonuses are: Win = −5, Top 5 = −3, Top 10 = −2, Top 20 = −1, else 0

If golfer misses the cut (or WD/DQ):
  Fantasy Score = Tier MC Penalty (replaces actual score)

Player Total = Sum of all 10 golfer fantasy scores
```

### Scoring Examples

**Example 1:** Scottie Scheffler (Tier 1) wins the Masters at −12.
- Fantasy score = −12 − 5 (win bonus) = **−17**

**Example 2:** Shane Lowry (Tier 2) finishes T8 at −4.
- Fantasy score = −4 − 2 (top 10 bonus) = **−6**

**Example 3:** Cameron Smith (Tier 3) finishes T25 at +1.
- Fantasy score = +1 (no bonus) = **+1**

**Example 4:** Scottie Scheffler (Tier 1) misses the cut.
- Fantasy score = **+10** (Tier 1 MC penalty, replaces actual score)

**Example 5:** Bubba Watson (Tier 6) misses the cut.
- Fantasy score = **+5** (Tier 6 MC penalty, replaces actual score)

**Example 6:** Full lineup calculation.

| Pick | Golfer | Tier | Result | Calculation | Score |
|------|--------|------|--------|-------------|-------|
| T1-A | Scheffler | 1 | Wins at −12 | −12 − 5 (Win) | −17 |
| T1-B | Åberg | 1 | T15 at −3 | −3 − 1 (Top 20) | −4 |
| T2-A | Morikawa | 2 | T3 at −8 | −8 − 3 (Top 5) | −11 |
| T2-B | Spieth | 2 | Missed cut | Tier 2 penalty | +9 |
| T3-A | Cantlay | 3 | T22 at E | 0 (no bonus) | 0 |
| T3-B | Burns | 3 | T10 at −2 | −2 − 2 (Top 10) | −4 |
| T4-A | Fowler | 4 | Missed cut | Tier 4 penalty | +7 |
| T4-B | Theegala | 4 | T18 at −1 | −1 − 1 (Top 20) | −2 |
| T5 | Tiger Woods | 5 | Missed cut | Tier 5 penalty | +6 |
| T6 | Bubba Watson | 6 | T30 at +3 | +3 (no bonus) | +3 |
| | | | **TOTAL** | | **−13** |

## 5. TIEBREAKER SYSTEM

At registration, players submit a prediction:

**Predict the winning score to par** (e.g., "−11")

The winning score for tiebreaker purposes is the winner's **regulation 72-hole score to par**, excluding any playoff strokes. If the Masters ends in a playoff, the winning score is the 72-hole score shared by the playoff participants.

**Tiebreaker Resolution:**
1. Closest to the actual winning score (absolute difference)
2. If still tied: Co-champions

---

## 8. EDGE CASES

| Scenario | Handling |
|----------|----------|
| Golfer withdraws before deadline | Removed from tier; players who picked them must re-pick before deadline |
| Golfer withdraws after deadline (WD) | Treated as missed cut; tier MC penalty applies — regardless of whether the golfer has teed off. Once the pick deadline passes, any withdrawal is treated as a missed cut. |
| Golfer disqualified (DQ) | Treated as missed cut; tier MC penalty applies |
| Playoff occurs | Regulation 72-hole score used; playoff result determines finish position for bonus purposes |
| Tied finish position | All tied golfers get the same bonus (e.g., T4 all get Top 5 bonus) |
| Weather delay extends tournament | Final scores used regardless of schedule changes |
| Tournament shortened (< 72 holes) | Scores based on official final standings as declared by Augusta National. If the tournament is canceled entirely, all entries are void. |
| Golfer not in final field | Removed from tier before deadline; admin notifies players |
| New golfer qualifies before deadline | Added to appropriate tier based on odds; admin notifies players |
| New golfer qualifies after deadline | Not available for selection; excluded from the pool |
| Identical total score AND tiebreaker | Co-champions |

- 6-tier structure determined by K-means clustering on log(implied probability)
- Silhouette score: 0.570 (good cluster separation)

### Tier Statistics (Simulated)

| 6 | 18 | <0.1% | 0.4% | 3.7% | 21% | −2.6 |

### Fantasy Pool Simulation (30,000 simulations, 20-player pools)

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Avg winning lineup score | −45.3 |
| Avg last place score | +30.8 |
| Avg 1st-to-last spread | 76.1 strokes |
| Avg margin of victory (1st vs 2nd) | 9.5 strokes |
| Median margin of victory | 7.2 strokes |

### Tier Contribution Analysis (Winners vs. Field)

| Tier | Picks | Winner Avg | Field Avg | Winner Edge |
|------|-------|-----------|-----------|-------------|
| 1 | 2 | −22.1 | −13.5 | +8.6 |
| 2 | 2 | −13.5 | −4.0 | +9.5 |
| 3 | 2 | −8.8 | +0.6 | +9.4 |
| 4 | 2 | −3.2 | +4.2 | +7.4 |
| 5 | 1 | +0.3 | +2.9 | +2.6 |
| 6 | 1 | +2.0 | +3.4 | +1.4 |

*Note: All values rounded independently from simulation data. Winner Edge is computed from unrounded values and may not equal the exact difference of the displayed rounded averages.*

### Key Design Validations
- ✅ Every tier shows measurable improvement when optimized vs. random
- ✅ Tier 1 contributes the most to winning lineups (+8.6 Winner Edge) — as intended
- ✅ Even Tier 6 shows a Winner Edge (+1.4) — no throwaway picks
- ✅ 38% of pools finish within 5 strokes — exciting, competitive
- ✅ Scheffler holders win 40% of pools (vs. 29% baseline) — favored but not dominant
- ✅ Avg winner has 2.3 missed cuts out of 10 — variance keeps it interesting
- ✅ 72+ billion unique lineups — no duplicate lineups possible
